    <h2>Couscous</h2>

    <p>Couscous is a traditional North African dish made from small steamed balls of semolina flour. It has been a
        staple food in North Africa for centuries and is now enjoyed in many parts of the world.
        The origins of couscous are uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in the Berber culture of North
        Africa, where it has been a staple food for thousands of years. Historically, couscous was made by hand, using a
        special clay pot called a couscoussier and a sieve-like instrument called a kiskis.</p>

    <p>Over time, the preparation of couscous evolved and became more efficient, with the introduction of mechanized
        milling and steaming techniques. Today, couscous is typically made from durum wheat, which is ground into
        semolina flour and then formed into small balls by rolling and steaming.

        Couscous is a versatile dish that can be served with a variety of meats, vegetables, and sauces, making it a
        popular choice in many cuisines. In North Africa, it is often served with lamb or chicken and a vegetable stew
        called a tagine. In other parts of the world, couscous is used in salads, as a side dish, or as a base for other
        dishes.</p>

    <p>Overall, couscous is a beloved dish that has a rich history and cultural significance in North Africa and beyond.
